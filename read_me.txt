Hello and welcome to Tag Map! This is a very simple web application that uses both the Instagram and Google Maps API. Tag Map finds the nine most recent Instagram pictures taken within a 5km radius of downtown Salinas, CA. It then plots the location of where the picture was taken on a google map. The search bar is used to filter the images. You have to sign into Instagram in order to use this application.
